# Steam Game Recommender

## Build

Run `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload` in the project folder to build it before starting the server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Notes

Currently, it is running the model based on a single random user's information that I manually gave it. I plan on adding the ability for users to sign in to Steam for the model to use their information instead.
